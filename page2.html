      <h1>WHO</h1>
        <h3>
          I am Garret. My pronouns are he/his. I mainly do video editing and camera work,
          but I enjoy learning and making stuff in a wide variety of digital mediums.
          I've used almost every available software in the adobe suite,
          I have learned Python, Java, C#, C++, and probably some others as well in a more rudimentary way.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        I've been making digital stuff since I was first able to use a computer.
        Messing around in free video editing software and game engines.
        Unfortunately I no longer have a lot of the stuff that I made a while ago,
        but I hope that this site can hold my current and future work!
      </h3>
      <h3>
        During my free time I like to consume creative media to gather ideas for future projects.
        YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, everything has a little something that you could take away from it.
        I really like all types of stuff though, so if you have anything that fits that <a href="page4.html">let me know</a>!
        I would be more than happy to have more interesting stuff to look at.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Oh I also really like animals! I've had animals my whole life and they are just the best!
        <p><em>(I just felt that needed to be said)</em></p>
